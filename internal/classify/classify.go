// Package classify houses the shared SeaDex-to-release classification glue: the
// single construction of a release.Release from a seadex.Torrent (in the
// context of its entry) that both the compare (findings) and audit (report)
// flows depend on. Keeping it in one place means the two flows classify an
// identical SeaDex release identically and cannot silently diverge if the
// release.Input contract gains a field. It is a seadex-aware adapter so the
// release package can stay a pure, seadex-free leaf.
